# Clickbait-Classifier
Clickbait is a term that describes deceiving web content that uses ambiguity to
provoke the user into clicking a link.
• It aims to increase the number of online readers in order to generate more
advertising revenue.
• These baits may trick the readers into clicking, but in the long run, clickbait usually
doesn’t live up to the expectation of the readers and leave them disappointed.
Motivation: The automatic detection of clickbaits alerts readers of various media
websites to the potential of falling for such headlines.
